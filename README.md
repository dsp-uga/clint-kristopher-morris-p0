Introduction:
-----------------
This project featured four sub-projects, testing various approaches of word counting and calculating TF-IDF scores.

* S1 takes the books contained within the data folder and calculates the top 40 most commonly used words after converting to uniform letter case.

* S2 repeats the task of S1 but also removes “stop words” located in the data folder.

* S3 assumes the goals of S2 in addition it removes leading and trailing punctuation.

* S3 calculates the top 5 TF-IDF scores from each book and complies them together.

Technologies Used:
-----------------
- Python 3.5
- Apache Spark
